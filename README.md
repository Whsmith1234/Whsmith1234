# Whsmith1234
Currently working on making NFTs cheaper and better for the environment by building them on top of Adamant.im's proof of stake blockchain network.<br>
Learning more about cryptography and statistics as I go.<br>
Thanks for being interested enough to come this far.<br>
Cross chain Dex next <br>
Have a great day!
